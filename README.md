# BB_Biodiversity

## Overview

This module taught us how to create an interactive dashboard for a user to review various demographic information regarding participants in a study.

## Resources

The class was provided with the data for this study in the file samples.json.  Using the D3 library to read this file we then performed the following tasks:

1. Created a filter for each "name" in the data set.  The name represented the participants ID 
2. Created a horizontal bar chart to identify the top 10 bacteria cultures for the chosen participant
3. Created a gauge chart to identify the frequency of washing during the week
4. Created a bubble chart to as another way to visualize the total bacteria cultures of a participant

## Final Steps
Since this is reading a static file the ability for other people to see this analysis requires another step in posting this to the repository.  In GitHub we will utilize their free static page hosting services.
